[Problem Description]

You want to create an editor program that manipulates two large numbers.

The editor must be able to perform the following functions.

1. The editor provides two lines, and a number is written in each line.

2. You can attach a number to the left or right side of the number written in the editor.

3. When a number is created by connecting the two numbers written in the editor in order,
  the editor must be able to count how many times a specific number appears in the number.

The editor provides two lines, and large numbers, each of which is to be written in each line, are given.

Each of the given numbers are composed of an array of digits ranging from 1 to 9

You can complete a number by connecting the digits given in the array.

The following two lines show numbers created by using the digits given in arrays.

[5, 4, 3, 1, 9, 5, 5, 1, 1, 1] à 5431955111

[1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 4, 4, 3, 1, 1] à 111212121244311

Initially, each of the given numbers are written in each line of the editor.


You can attach a number to the left or right side of the number written in the editor.

If you attach 215 to the left side of 5431955111, it becomes 2155431955111.

If you attach 215 to the right side of 5431955111, it becomes 5431955111215.

 
When a number is created by connecting the two numbers written in the editor in order,
the editor must be able to count how many times a specific number appears in the number.

The specific number is a 3-digit number.

If 5431955111 and 111212121244311 are written in order in the editor,
the number created by connecting them is 5431955111111212121244311.


In the created number, 431 appears 2 times in the locations marked with black lines in [Fig.1] (a).

In the created number, 121 appears 3 times in the locations marked with black lines in [Fig.1] (b).

In the created number, 111 appears 4 times in the locations marked with black lines in [Fig.1] (c).


Implement each required function by referring to the following API description.

※ The function signature below is based on C/C++. As for other languages, refer to the provided Main and User Code.

 
The following is the description of API to be written in the User Code.

void init(int mCnt1, int mDigitList1[30000],
                                   int mCnt2, int mDigitList2[30000])

This function is called at the beginning of each test case.
Information on the numbers, each of which is to be written in each line, is given.

The number to be written in the first line is given as mDigitList1 composed of mCnt1 digits.

The i+1th digit from the left is mDigitList1[i]. (0 ≤ i ≤ mCnt1-1)

The number to be written in the second line is given as mDigitList2 composed of mCnt2 digits.

The i+1th digit from the left is mDigitList2[i]. (0 ≤ i ≤ mCnt2-1)

It is guaranteed that each digit ranges from 1 to 9.

__Parameters

_    mCnt1 : Number of digits of the number to be written in the first line (10 ≤ mCnt1 ≤ 30,000)
_    mDigitList1[i] : The (i+1)th digit of the number to be written in the first line (1 ≤ mDigitList1[i] ≤ 9)
_    mCnt2 : Number of digits of the number to be written in the second line (10 ≤ mCnt2 ≤ 30,000)
_    mDigitList2[i] : The (i+1)th digit of the number to be written in the second line (1 ≤ mDigitList2[i] ≤ 9)

void append(int mDir, int mNum1, int mNum2)

This function attaches a number to the left or right side of the number written in the editor.

If mDir = 0, the given number is written on the left.
If mDir = 1, the given number is written on the right.

mNum1 is attached to the number in the first line.

mNum2 is attached to the number in the second line.

mNum1 and mNum2 are composed of maximum 4 digits.

It is guaranteed that mNum1 and mNum2 do not contain 0.

For example, 102 or 40 is not given.

For each test case, it is guaranteed that the function is called up to 20,000 times when mDir=0.

For each test case, it is guaranteed that the function is called up to 20,000 times when mDir=1.

__Parameters

____ mDir : Direction where the number is to be attached (0 ≤ mDir ≤ 1)
____ mNum1 : Number to be attached to the first line (1 ≤ mNum1 ≤ 9999)
____ mNum2 : Number to be attached to the second line (1 ≤ mNum2 ≤ 9999)

int countNum(int mNum)

This function returns the number of times mNum appears in the number created by connecting the two numbers written in the editor in order.

If mNum does not appear, 0 is returned.

mNum is always a 3-digit number.

It is guaranteed that mNum does not contain 0.

For example, 102 or 340 is not given.


__Parameters

____ mNum : Number whose appearance is to be counted (111 ≤ mNum ≤ 999)

 
__Returns

 Number of times the given number appears

[Constraints]

1. init() is called at the beginning of each test case.

2. For each test case, append() is called up to 30,000 times.

3. For each test case, countNum() is called up to 30,000 times.
