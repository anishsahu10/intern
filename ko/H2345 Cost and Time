[Problem Description]

There are N cities. Each city has an ID value that ranges from 0 to N-1.

There are one-way roads that connect the cities. When you take a road, information on the cost and time required is provided.

Given the maximum cost limit M and the departure and arrival cities, you want to find the minimum time required.
(If you want to use Dijkstra algorithm, you need to expand the one-dimensional array to a two-dimensional array.)

void init(int N, int K, int sCity[], int eCity[], int mCost[], int mTime[])

This function is called in the beginning of each test case.

N cities are given. Each city has an ID value that ranges from 0 to N-1.

Information on K roads, including departure and arrival cities and the cost and time required for each road is given.

The one-way roads only allow you to travel from the departure city to arrival city.

There can be more than one road with the same direction of traffic flow that connect the same pair of cities.

There is no case in which the departure city and arrival city are the same.

 

Parameters

  N: Number of cities ( 5 ≤ N ≤ 100 )

  K: Number of roads ( 3 ≤ K ≤ 500 )

 

  For every i (0 ≤ i ＜ K),

  sCity[i]: Departure city of Road i ( 0 ≤ sCity[i] < N )

  eCity[i]: Arrival city of Road i ( 0 ≤ eCity[i] < N )

  mCost[i]: Cost required for Road i ( 1 ≤ mCost[i] ≤ 100 )

  mTime[i]: Time required for Road i ( 1 ≤ mTime[i] ≤ 100 )

void add(int sCity, int eCity, int mCost, int mTime)

This function adds a road that connects sCity to eCity, costs mCost, and requires mTime to travel.

Only the cities that are already given by init() are given.

There can be pre-existing roads that connect sCity to eCity.

 

Parameters

  sCity: Departure city of the road ( 0 ≤ sCity < N )

  eCity: Arrival City of the road ( 0 ≤ eCity < N )

  mCost: Cost required for the road ( 1 ≤ mCost ≤ 100 )

  mTime: Time required for the road ( 1 ≤ mTime ≤ 100 )

int cost(int M, int sCity, int eCity)

If the maximum cost limit is set to M, this function returns the minimum time required to travel from sCity to eCity.

There is no case in which the departure city and arrival city are the same.

 

Parameters

  M: Maximum cost limit ( 1 ≤ M ≤ 1,000 )

  sCity: Departure city ( 0 ≤ sCity < N )

  eCity: Arrival city ( 0 ≤ eCity < N )

 

Returns

  If it is possible to travel from sCity to eCity within the cost of M, return the minimum time required.

  If impossible, return -1.

[Constraints]

1. init() is called in the beginning of each test case.

2. For each test case, add() is called up to 1,000 times.

3. For each test case, cost() is called up to 100 times
